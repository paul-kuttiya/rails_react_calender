## React on rails(with gem)
###Setup
* specify `gem "react-rails"`  
* create react config in rails with command `rails g react:install` 
* query data in controller and pass in view  
~> define components name, and props  
~> pass data from controller as component props  
```ruby
#assign @appointments as 'appointments' props in component Appointments  
= react_component 'Appointments', appointments: @appointments
```

##Create components
* create components for `Appointments`, `Appointment`, `AppointmentLists` and `AppointmentForm`  
~> pass `appointments` prop from `Appointments` parent to `AppointmentLists`  
~> map each element and pass element to `Appointment` component as props  
~> render each component in `Apppointment` component  
~> create `render` for form component  

* set state to capture dynamic state when submit form for `Input` and `Appointments`   
~> define `getInitialState` to get object start state for `Appointments` component; `getInitialState` should be in parent component that shared among children  
~> change `this.props.appointments` in `AppointmentList` component to `state` to reflect the latest data from `getInitialState`  
```js
//Appointments component
getInitialState: function() {
  return {
    appointments: this.props.appointments,
    title: '',
    appt_time: 'appointment time'
  }
},
```
~> pass state as props to `AppointmentForm` component  
~> set event `onChange` and value in `AppontmentForm` from `Appointments` passed down state as props  
```jsx
<input type="text" name="appt_time" placeholder="Date and time" value={this.props.appt_time} onChange={this.handleChange} />
```
~> create event handler `handleChange` for input and call `this.props.handleInput(obj)`  
```js
//AppointmentForm
handleChange: function(e) {
  var name = e.target.name,
      obj = {};
  
  obj[name] = e.target.value;
  this.props.handleInput(obj);
},
```
~> create `handleInput` in parent `Appointments` component, then create `setState` inside `handleInput` function, and pass down to `AppointmentForm`  
```js
//Appointments
handleInput: function(obj) {
  this.setState(obj)
},
``` 

* setup event for form submission
